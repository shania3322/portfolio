## Projects completed at HBKsaar

Project Name: Dancing Symbols\
Date: 2017\
Tools: processing, kinect\

[Demo and Doc](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16WN8cKwzarvPc1dPKG1tMs9iqw_yYcwb?usp=sharing) \
Description: My first project developed via processing. The project took the
depth map of human body captured by kinect and projected the data points on a
screen in a form of 2D strokes.

Project Name: Self-replicated City\
Date: 2018\
Tools: processing\

[Demo and Doc](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UqjcbIEEzXeRk3arXhVuc-Vo2iQTGpol?usp=sharing) \
Description: The project is based on Conway's Game of Life. Movement and shape
deformation were added on the top of cells evolution pattern.

## Internship at Andreas Greiner Studio
Project Name: Jungle Memory\
Date: 2019\
Tools: Generative Neural Network (GAN), pytorch, tensor flow\
Link: [link](http://www.andreasgreiner.com/works/jungle-memory/) \
Description: The project is part of an installation exhibition. The programming
part is aiming to generate synthesized forest images with trained GAN.
